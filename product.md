# PLANNABLE

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

Our product is a WEBSITE / DESKTOP APP planner for students that takes user input to generate a plan/timetable detailing how they should spend their time for each course.

The target problem we are trying to solve is figuring out how to organize the day to get things done, considering some tasks require more time and effort than others. It will be similar to existing timetable apps, except that it does the planning for the user, based on their preferences.

A common use case may proceed as follows: A university student has final exams coming up, but is unsure how to budget their time wisely. They know that in the past, they have had a tendency to overstudy and over-prepare for their first couple of exams, but leave little to no time for the following ones.

Our product would assist this student by calculating a study schedule based on factors such as prioritization of the courses (which ones require more study time), the student’s available hours (how many hours they are willing to dedicate), and breaks.

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Target Users: For the limited time we have in the course, we are focusing on university students as our main target audience. Users will be academic oriented individuals who have an interest in better management of their study time.
 * The following persona is an example of the typical user we envision using our product:
..* Hardworking Harry is a third year Computer Science specialist student at the University of Toronto. His course workload this year has tremendously increased, and he is also trying to find a PEY placement. Since he gives a hundred percent in every assignment, he often finds himself running out of time. He wants to optimize his time to finish his coursework and be awesome and sleep.

#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?

University can be a really hectic experience, and students often have trouble prioritizing their time so that they can do well in school. While applications that allow students to create their own schedules already exist, they do not cover the cases for when students simply do not know how to prioritize their time well enough to maximize their productivity. That is where our app comes in. Our app is different in that it will prioritize the students’ time for their assignments, studies, review, and extracurriculars such as clubs and sports. It achieves this with the use of an algorithm so that students don’t have to plan it themselves. It can save users a lot of time, since they now don’t have to rigorously think about how they should spend their time, and instead have an app do it for them.

### Highlights

1. Idea
 * Time planner
 * Users are presented with an empty calendar where they can input their current schedule information (i.e. class times, extracurricular commitments, etc.). Users are also able to mark which courses they find more important. The app in turn produces an augmented calendar based on the user’s schedule with suggested study times added. The study times are split into each course based on the user’s prioritization of their courses and difficulty
 * We also considered making an app that could translate english text online to other languages in a pop-up
 * But ultimately, we decided on the idea of making a schedule planner because we feel it has the most originality and potential for a full-fledged application. Whereas building a language tool is fairly simple and has already been done many times, we noted that creating a planner would give us more room to pick/concentrate on the features we want to provide for the user
 * We also feel it could benefit more people in terms of assistance with student time management and planning being a issue
2. Platform for the application
 * Java (Desktop) app
 * Although we also considered an Android app, members of the development team have the most experience working on a desktop app, in comparison to using Android studio
 * It may also be more convenient to input schedule times using a desktop vs. a phone, due to the larger screen space
3. Communication options
 * Slack, Git, Google Drive, combination
 * Slack provides a convenient way to facilitate team communication 
 * Github is easily integratable with Slack
 * Github for reliable version control
