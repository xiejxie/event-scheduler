# PLANNABLE

Plannable is a planner desktop app for students that takes user input to generate a plan/timetable detailing how they should spend their time for each course.

The target problem we are trying to solve is figuring out how to organize the day to get things done, considering some tasks require more time and effort than others. It will be similar to existing timetable apps, except that it does the planning for the user, based on their preferences.

## Use
A common use case may proceed as follows: A university student has final exams coming up, but is unsure how to budget their time wisely. They know that in the past, they have had a tendency to over-study for their first couple of exams, but leave little to no time for the following ones. Plannable assists this student by optimizing a study schedule based on factors such as estimated time required to completion, the studentâ€™s available hours (how many hours they are willing to dedicate), and breaks. The student's own prioritization ratings are used to assign weightings to each task for customized results.
