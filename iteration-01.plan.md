# PLANNABLE

## Iteration 01

 * Start date: Oct 5, 2017
 * End date: Oct 13, 2017

## Process

#### Roles & responsibilities

Product Owner: Alisia
(This individual is responsible for communicating the overall needs of the end users and how the product can meet these needs. This helps guide the team in making the design decisions that allows the application to have the maximum benefit to the end users.)

Brainstormers: Everybody
(All team members were responsible for contributing in decision making - the specific decisions are listed below. Individuals have to convey the positive and negative aspects of each decision and help the group come to a suitable compromise)
 
Designers: Jing Yi, Egan
(These team members are responsible for generating visual representations of the what the final user interface of the application should look like. This is in the form of images and prototypes)

Technical Writer/Proofreader: Charles, Julian
(These members are responsible for proofreading all written communication materials - such as these three documents. Proofreading includes checking for grammatical errors and ensuring that ideas are communicated succinctly) 

Writers: Everyone else
(All team members are responsible for contributing to the write up of communication materials)

Development Team : Everyone (specifics TBD)
(Although we have not yet begun any development, we expect that all team members will be part of the development team. A further division of duties will be communicated in the next iteration)

#### Events

Currently, we are planning on having two weekly meetings. One will take place in tutorial on Tuesdays and the other will be a 2 hour meeting on Fridays. Since our tutorials are usually less than an hour long, we will reserve this time for discussing any immediately pressing issues that have arisen for specific team members. We will discuss the issue as a group and come to an agreement on how that individual or those individuals should proceed. This would give the team member or team members time to think about and implement the suggested solution and give relevant feedback in the Friday meeting. The Friday meeting would be reserved for discussing what has been completed in the current sprint, any new ideas, discussing fixes from Tuesday’s meeting, and eliminating any new obstacles that are hindering progress. We will also spend some time reviewing the product backlog and planning what to do next.

We also plan on having stand up meetings via Slack. Whenever a team member has completed a section of code, they can notify others via Slack that the task has been completed. Team members can also notify each other when they are going to start working on a certain task and when they have run into roadblocks so they can get instant feedback.

#### Artifacts

We will come into our Friday planning meeting with a to-do list of tasks that we need to complete in this sprint. In the meeting, we will prioritize tasks based on how essential they are for moving our product development forward. The tasks which need to be implemented to move on to the next sprint will have the highest priority. The Friday meeting will also be used to assign tasks based on whoever has the most experience with the tools used to complete the task, as well as making sure the workload is divided evenly. During the rest of the week, Slack will be used if team members are having trouble finishing their tasks, and feel that it would be better if someone else were to take over. Tasks that we feel can be implemented in the upcoming sprint will be set aside and the rest will be put into the project backlog.

We will be using GitHub Projects mainly for individual work that needs to be assigned to specific team members. For example, in this sprint, this would include which team members are creating UI images, and which respective images they will create. Or, which team members are typing up the responses to which questions in these three documents. GitHub projects also lets us see which tasks are in the backlog, in progress, and completed. As deadlines approach, we can take a look at which tasks are still in the backlog and in progress sections, helping us to re-prioritize or reassign tasks during the weekly meetings. Since the GitHub to-dos can be assigned to team members, it also allows us to see what everyone else is working on in order to prevent inefficient work overlaps.

Additionally, GitHub Projects will be used as a to-do list/task board for development.  This will keep track of outstanding tasks and progress made by the team and it will be visible to the entire team at all times.

Slack will be the main method of messaging and immediate communications. A general channel will be used for more casual topics and logistics. A code-review/development channel will be used for discussing actual content and remote teamwork.

Prototyping software (ie. JustInMind) will be used to create prototypes to focus our development and avoid straying away from the planned idea.

## Product

#### Goals and tasks

1) Interviewing potential app users

We were initially planning on speaking to other students regarding their experiences around scheduling their time and planning what to work on when. We were going to use this information in order to make decisions about what features the app definitely needs to have. However, since all our team members are students and we could also be users of this application, we found that it would be more efficient if we just polled this information from our own experiences instead.

2) Building app prototype

We initially planned on having a full prototype of our application. We wanted to see how users can interact with the app and what the resulting images would look like. However, for this sprint, we did not have enough time to be able to implement all the interactive features in the prototype. We were able to create images of what certain screens would look like and what would happen if users pressed some (but not all) of the buttons. However, we plan on fully implementing the prototype in the next sprint.

#### Artifacts

Since a lot of our tasks for this sprint will involve having team discussions to make decisions, most of our artifacts will be summaries of our discussions. These summaries will succinctly outline the issues we were facing and the decisions that were made. If any team members are unclear on how we are planning on moving forward, they can refer to these summaries. This is crucial for our team so that we can be sure that everyone is on the same page when it comes to large decisions regarding how our project will move forward.

We will also be using images as artifacts to display the different possible screens the application could have. This artifact is important since a visual  representation of the product is extremely powerful for when team members are discussing what end product they are building towards. Similarly, we will also be building prototypes to demonstrate what the application will look like and how users will be able to interact with it. This is an important artifact since it is a more immersive way to showcase the product before it’s fully developed. This way, we can easily pinpoint errors and find room for improvement.
