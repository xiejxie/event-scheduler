# PLANNABLE

## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 13, 2017
 * Where: Bahen 2nd Floor

## Process - Reflection

#### Decisions that turned out well

1) Having a meeting time outside of tutorial

Although all of our team members did attend the tutorial during this sprint, it was hard to discuss and make decisions in the limited amount of time we had. The meetings we had on both Fridays let the team sit down for two hours and fully discuss our project and the direction we saw it going. This was a much more efficient means of communication than discussing the same topics online as we were able to get results much faster. We definitely plan on keeping this meeting at this time and for this duration in future sprints. 

2) Using a to-do list to organize decisions

Since this was our first sprint, there were a lot of decisions that had to be made about the idea we were picking and how we plan on implementing it. We first made a list of all the decisions we had to make before the meeting to ensure that by the end of the sprint, every team member had a solid idea of where our project is going. During our Friday meeting, we went through each item on the list and had a discussion surrounding the best way to approach and solve that problem. This ensured that we were able to have an organized and productive meeting.

3) Agreeing on one prototyping software to use

Another good process decision we made was agreeing on one prototyping software to use. While we were building images/prototypes, we were consistently building on top of each other’s ideas instead of building completely new ideas. Using the same prototyping software allowed us to take what our team members have already done and add to it. However, had we used different software, the same image might not have been reproducible in the new software, forcing team members to come up with new ideas of what our app should look like. This helped us to focus the UI of our app to one central idea instead of multiple smaller ones. 

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

1) Using Slack vs. Facebook messenger

In our planning meeting, we had decided that we were going to be using Slack as our primary mode of instant messaging and communication. However, we had set up a Facebook Messenger chat prior to our planning meeting. Thus, during our sprint we were using both Facebook and Slack as our mode of communication. As a result, we didn’t have one primary platform upon which all our discussions took place and decisions were made. Thus, depending on who checked what platform, not everyone was always informed about project decisions. Moving forward, we would like to primarily stick with Slack because of its integrability with Github. 

2) Using Git more than Google docs

In order to write up these three documents, we used a Google Doc as our GitHub projects were not set up yet when we started. However, we never made the transition from contributing to the Google doc to contributing to the documents on Github. We missed our opportunity to work together and contribute to common files on GitHub. This would’ve given us the chance to resolve any GitHub issues earlier on so we could be more prepared for when we started development. In the future, we will need to start using GitHub and correct our process if we run into issues then.

3) Using Github Projects more

Since this iteration was mostly focused on making design decisions as a group about our app, we didn’t see the need to use Github Projects just yet. There was no need to assign tasks to specific individuals, rather we just required more time for discussions. Thus, we relied primarily on the to-do lists mentioned above. We primarily split the group up into writers and designers. Each individual was aware of the role that they had and contributed to the collective goal they were assigned. Thus, there was no pressing need to assign specific tasks. However, moving forward, as we start the coding phases, we will need to reevaluate and will probably be using GitHub projects. 

#### Planned changes

Looking back at the process we drafted at the beginning of this sprint, we still believe that we had a good and solid idea of what our process should look like. However, our main challenge in this sprint was sticking to the process itself. As mentioned above, before our Git and Slack were set up, we were using alternative platforms. As we moved through the sprint, we transitioned a bit to our planned platforms, but we never did a complete transition. This resulted in discussions happening on one platform (eg. Slack) but not reaching other team members because they were only checking Facebook. Moving forward, we still believe that we have a strong idea for our team process that doesn’t need to be changed just yet. However, in our next sprint, as a team we are going to focus on following the guidelines we set out and then adjusting the process as need be.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

1) Made all decisions set out to make in our to-do list

In our team meeting, we will be able to meet up for 2 hours and discuss all the items on the to-do list we initially created in our planning meeting. We were able to go through the whole list and annotate it so everyone has a copy of what decisions we made. We also updated it throughout the sprint to reflect decisions we made through online communications.

2) Created communication channels

We set up our Slack page (as shown below) and used it to communicate with each other on general design decisions about the project. Below is a screenshot of a sample conversation we had on Slack.

3) Built UI images for our app

The designers in our team were able to put together some images of their visions for our app. These images were reviewed and approved by all members of the team (and relevant suggestions were made). Although, there was not enough time to build a full prototype, they were able to demonstrate minimal interactivity by letting users see the result of clicking on some buttons.

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

1) Interviewing potential app users

We were initially planning on speaking to other students regarding their experiences around scheduling their time and planning what to work on when. We were going to use this information in order to make decisions about what features the app definitely needs to have. However, since all our team members are students and we could also be users of this application, we found that it would be more efficient if we just polled this information from our own experiences instead.

2) Building app prototype

We initially planned on having a full prototype of our application. We wanted to see how users can interact with the app and what the resulting images would look like. However, for this sprint, we did not have enough time to be able to implement all the interactive features in the prototype. We were able to create images of what certain screens would look like and what would happen if users pressed some (but not all) of the buttons. However, we plan on fully implementing the prototype in the next sprint. 

## Meeting Highlights

Main Goals - Implementing These Features Fully In Code

1) Adding Classes You Have and Your Free Time Slots

This feature will allow the user to input their weekly schedules(similar to Google Calendar), which the program will then take as part of the input into the algorithm to calculate work scheduling.

2) Choosing Priority and Difficulty of Courses

This is one of the main features that our app will offer. It allows users to choose which courses they want to prioritize on, like for example a hard course that they need more time on. The app will respond accordingly by allocating more time for that course. We want to focus on this feature as it is extremely important in the functionality of our program.

3) Building the Algorithm to Assign What To Work on When

This is the most important and key feature to our application, which calculates the amount of time to spend on each task and organize it into the available blocks.

4) Transition fully to using GitHub Projects and Slack

This will focus the team in a more organized manner so that there are only two sources of communication to check and keep up with.  Slack also has better integration with the tools we will be using so shifting to Slack will make tasks more convenient.

Optional (if we have extra time)

1) Notifications when project deadlines approaching

2) Marking for completion

3) Basic UI features
