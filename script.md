Introduction (30-45s)

Our application, Plannable, is a time management tool for university students. However, unlike other organization 
tools, Plannable allows you to enter what times you’d like to study and what tasks you need to complete. It then 
assigns tasks for you to complete during each of your study times and even suggests how long should be spent on 
each task. The main problem Plannable is trying to solve is the challenge of prioritizing what to work on when. 
As university students, we often find that after working for some time, we haven’t finished urgent tasks or haven’t 
made as much progress as we would have liked. Plannable is our solution to this problem. The following is a demo of 
how to use our application.
